## ClickyGameDisneyCats

## Overview
Created a React Clicky game which requires user to click on different images in order to get the points. If the player happens to click on the same image twice, the score gets reset to 0. The app keeps the count of scores and top scores player earns each time. When the game stops, player's current score is reset and the top score stays. The player either can continue playing or try again beating the current top score.

### Folder Structure

For this app, I have followed an specified folder structre and Created the main Reop called ClickGameDisneyCats. Inside the folder, created React Client app. Created all the components and organized them for easy access and understaning!

### How the app works

1. The application renders different images of Disney famous cats to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
